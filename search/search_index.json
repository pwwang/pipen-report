They are defined in filters.py and can be used in the template files. datatable Read data from a file, using pandas.read_csv() and make it to json so js can handle it and render it with <DataTable /> Args: path (PathLike): The path to the data file. *args (Any): Additional positional arguments to pass to pandas.read_csv(). ncols (Union[int, Iterable], optional): Either the number of columns to select or an iterable of column indices or names. Defaults to None. nrows (Union[int, Iterable], optional): Either the number of rows to select or an iterable of row indices. Defaults to None. double_precision (int, optional): The precision for double numbers. See also pandas.DataFrame.to_json(). Defaults to 4. excluded (set, optional): A set of column names to exclude from the resulting DataFrame. Defaults to None. **kwargs (Any): Additional keyword arguments to pass to pandas.read_csv(). Note that sep is set to \"\\t\" instead of , by default. Returns: str : A JSON format of the data. Examples: < DataTable data = \"{{ '/path/to/data.tsv' | datatable: nrows=10) }}\" /> < DataTable data = \"{{ '/path/to/data.tsv' | datatable: nrows=10, excluded={'col1', 'col2'}) }}\" /> render_job Generate the svelte components for a job. Args: job (Mapping[str, Any]): The job object used to render the template. report_file (str): Absolute path to a report file or relative to job.outdir h (int): The starting level of the headers Examples: A json should be defined at <job.outdir>/report.json for the report structure: { \"h1\" : { \"h2\" : { \"h3\" : { \"ui\" : [ { \"kind\" : \"datatable\" , \"src\" : \"data.tsv\" }, # more compo nents ] } } } } The h2 and h3 are optional. You can set them to #xxx to let pipen-report to ignore them. Same h2 s are also supported. You can use #<suffiex> to make them different. For example, Heading2#1 and Heading2#2 to have two h2 with the same name under the same h1 . For details of ui and components, see following sections. render_ui Render a set of components with a certain ui layout. In the report.json file, under h3 , you should specify a dict with ui keys, which defined a large set of components. Supported ui s are: flat : The components will be rendered sequentially. tabs : The components will be rendered as tabs. Each component should be with kind \"tab\" . If not specified, kind = \"tab\" will be added automatically. table_of_images : The components will be rendered as a table of images. Each component should be with kind \"table_image\" . If not specified, kind = \"image\" will be added automatically. You can specify the number of columns like table_of_images:3 . The default number of columns is 2. accordion : The components will be rendered as an accordion. Each component should be with kind \"accordion\" . If not specified, kind = \"accordion\" will be added automatically. This can also be used as a filter in the template files by passing a json object and the ui : Args: contents (List[Mapping[str, Any]]): The contents of components to render. ui (str): The ui layout to render. job (Mapping[str, Any]): The job object used to render the template. level (int): The indent level of the components. Defaults to 0. UI: flat A flat ui will render the components sequentially. < Component1 /> < Component2 /> < Component3 /> <!-- ... --> UI: tabs A tabs ui will render the components as tabs.

If not specified, the size will be obtained from the image file using pillow . This is useful for the loading placeholder to have the same size as the image. Component: table_image Render a table of images. Full configuration of a table_image component: { \"kind\" : \"table_image\" , \"src\" : \"/path/to/image.png\" , # The path to the image file \"name\" : \"Image 1\" , # The name of the image \"descr\" : \"This is a description about the image.\" , # The description of the image # Other arguments passed to Image } This will be rendered as: < div > < Descr title = \"Image 1\" class = \"pipen-report-table-image-descr\" > This is a description about the image. </ Descr > < Image src = \"placeholder.png\" class = \"pipen-report-table-image\" width = { 526 } height = { 360 } /> </ div > Component: tab Render a tab. Full configuration of a tab component: { \"kind\" : \"tab\" , \"label\" : \"label of the tab\" , # or use key `name` or `title` \"ui\" : \"flat\" , # The ui of the components under this tab \"contents\" : [ ... ] # The components to render under this tab using the `ui` } This will be rendered as a tuple of Tab and TabContent : < Tab label = \"label of the tab\" /> <!-- and --> < TabContent > < ui of the components under this tab using the ` ui ` /> </ TabContent > See also the Tabs component of carbon-components-svelte . Component: tag You can also directly use a tag ( <tag ... /> ) as a component. Full configuration of a tag component: { \"kind\" : \"tag\" , \"tag\" : \"tag-name\" , # The tag name # Other attributes passed to the tag } This will be rendered as: < tag-name ... /> Attention To build the report using the above filters, you need to import the components in the template files manually: < script > import { Descr , Image , DataTable } from \"$libs\" ; import { Accordion , AccordionItem , Tabs , Tab , TabContent } from \"$ccs\" ; // import more if needed, e.g InlineNotification, OrderedList, UnorderedList, ListItem, etc </ script > {{ job | render_job }} Registering new component renderer pipen-report allows you to register new component renderer. For example, you can register a new component renderer for my-component : from pipen_report.filters import register_component , _tag @register_component ( \"my-component\" , \"mycomp\" ) def _render_my_component ( args , job , level ): \"\"\"Render my-component Args: args should be a dict with the following keys: - kind: The kind of the component, \"my-component\" or \"mycomp\" in this case - arg1: ... # The arguments passed to the component - arg2: ... - ... job: The job object used to render the template level: The indent level of the component \"\"\" # Rendered as # <div>This is my component</div> return _tag ( \"div\" , slot = \"This is my component\" , _level = level ) When the above component renderer is registered, my-component can be used in the report.json file: { \"h1\" : { \"h2\" : { \"h3\" : { \"ui\" : [ { \"kind\" : \"my-component\" , \"arg1\" : \"value1\" , \"arg2\" : \"value2\" } ] } } } } Or in the dict passed to the render_component filter: {{ { \"kind\" : \"my-component\", \"arg1\": \"value1\", \"arg2\": \"value2\"} | render_component }} Registering new ui renderer ui is a layout of components, which defines how the set of components are rendered. pipen-report allows you to register new ui renderer. For example, you can register a new ui renderer for grid : from pipen_report.filters import register_ui , render_component , _tag @register_ui ( \"grid\" ) def _render_my_ui ( contents , job , level ): \"\"\"Render grid ui Args: contents: The contents of components to render job: The job object used to render the template level: The indent level of the components \"\"\" return _tag ( \"div\" , slot = \" \\n \" . join ( _tag ( \"div\" , slot = render_component ( c , job , 2 ), _level = 1 ) for c in contents ), _level = level , style = \"display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(2, auto); \" ) This will render a grid ui as: < div style = \"display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(2, auto); \" > < div > < Component1 /> </ div > < div > < Component2 /> </ div > </ div > When the above ui renderer is registered, grid can be used in the report.json file: { \"h1\" : { \"h2\" : { \"h3\" : { \"grid\" : [ { \"kind\" : \"<component>\" , ... }, { \"kind\" : \"<component>\" , ... } ] } } } } Or in the dict passed to the render_ui filter: {{ [ { \"kind\": \"<component>\", ... }, { \"kind\": \"<component>\", ... } ] | render_ui : \"grid\" }} You can also pass extra arguments to the ui renderer. In the above example, for example, we can pass the number of columns to the grid ui, by registering the renderer as: @register_ui ( \"grid\" ) def _render_my_ui ( contents , job , level , arg : str | None = None ): \"\"\"Render grid ui The `arg` should be the residual of the ui name after the first `:`. For example, `grid:3` will pass `arg=\"3\"` to the renderer. \"\"\" arg = arg or \"2\" ncol = int ( arg ) return _tag ( \"div\" , slot = \" \\n \" . join ( _tag ( \"div\" , slot = render_component ( c , job , 2 ), _level = 1 ) for c in contents ), _level = level , style = f \"display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat( { ncol } , auto); \" )","title":"Filters for rendering"},{"location":"filters/#filters","text":"Filters are used in template rendering.

To use a builtin component: import { Image } from '../../components' ; // or use a shortcut import { Image } from '$libs' ; import { Image } from '$components' ; Thanks to the rollup-alias plugin, you can use the following aliases: { entries : [ { find : '$components' , replacement : '../../components' }, { find : '$component' , replacement : '../../components' }, { find : '$layouts' , replacement : '../../layouts' }, { find : '$layout' , replacement : '../../layouts' }, { find : '$libs' , replacement : '../../components' }, { find : '$lib' , replacement : '../../components' }, { find : '$extlibs' , replacement : '../../extlibs/{{extlibs.split(\"/\")[-1]}}' }, { find : '$ccs' , replacement : 'carbon-components-svelte' }, ] } DataTable An enhanced DataTable from carbon-components-svelte/DataTable . Additional features: Paginations enabled by default, with properties: page : set current page pageSize : set current page size pageSizes : allowed page sizes to set Sorting enabled by default (with sortable = true ) zebra set to true by default (with zebra = true ) Added a frame around the table, so tables and images can be aligned (better looking) You can set frameProps to null / undefined to disable it. Implemented download of data in the table or the entire data file if property src is set. Implemented search Allowing a single data property to pass data instead of headers and rows data is just rows , but headers will be inferred from it. Tip A datatable filter is added for python to render the template, so that we can read the data from a data file. < script > import { DataTable } from \"$libs\" ; </ script > < DataTable src = \"{{job.out.outfile}}\" data = { {{ job . out . outfile | datafile : sep = \"\\t\" }} } /> All other arguments will be passed to pandas.read_csv() except doule_precision , which will be passed to pandas.DataFrame.to_json() to control the precision of the numbers. Image An enhanced ImageLoader from carbon-components-svelte/ImageLoader Additional features: Similarly, a frame is added and enabled by default. To disable it, set frameProps to null / undefined Removed the width 100% style, added a class, and set the default width 45%. Added a modal when clicking on the image, the original dimension of the image is shown. Added \"open in new window\" for the image in the modal. Added a toolbar on the top-left corner of the image, with buttons to download the resources related to this image (i.e. the high-resolution image, the data file, etc.) To provide the information about the resources, use the data property. It should be: a list of objects or a single object, each object should have a src , tip and a icon property, where src is the path to the resource, tip is the tooltip, and icon is the icon to show. By default, the icon is auto, which will be inferred from the extension of the src . Available icons: DocumentPdf : Associated extensions: pdf ChartLineData : Associated extensions: html Png : Associated extensions: png Jpg : Associated extensions: jpg , jpeg Gif : Associated extensions: gif Svg : Associated extensions: svg Tif : Associated extensions: tif , tiff Archive : Associated extensions: zip , tar , gz , bz2 , xz , 7z , rar DatabaseElastic : Associated extensions: eps Data / DataVolume : No associated extensions, can be used for user specification IbmWatsonxCodeAssistantForZRefactor / Code : No associated extensions, can be used for user specification VideoPlayer : Associated extensions: mp4 , avi , mov , mkv , webm Image : No associated extensions, can be used for user specification DocumentDownload : Default icon a list of strings or a single string, each string will be the src and tip will be inferred from the src . The icon will be auto . Descr A component to show a description. Properties: title : the title of the description The content of the description is passed to the slot . Iframe An iframe component to embed an external page. Properties: src : the url of the page to embed width : the width of the iframe height : the height of the iframe title : the title of the iframe frameborder : the border of the iframe ref : the reference of the iframe (HTMLElement) resize : The way of resizing the iframe. Should be a CSS value of resize . Default is none . containerClass : The class of the container of the iframe. Default is \"\" . Plotly A component to show a plotly plot. The plot must be saved as an html file. Properties: frameProps : the properties of the frame around the plot. Default is {\"class\": \"pipen-report-plotly-frame\"} . src : the path to the plotly html file. title : the title of the plot (iframe) width : the width of the plot (iframe) height : the height of the plot (iframe) Markdown A markdown tag is processed at server side by python, which is not implemented as a svelte component. So you don't need to import it in script tag. Everything inside the <Markdown> is passed to markdown.markdown() from python Markdown package to convert to html. Advanced usage Using self-defined components Say you have a set of components that you want to use in all your reports. You can specify the path to the directory containing the components in report_extlibs by either pipen report config --extlibs <path> or pipeline.config.plugin_opts.report_extlibs = <path> . Then you can import the components from the path you specified. < script > import { MyComponent } from '$extlibs/MyComponent.svelte' ; </ script > You can write your own components based on carbon-components-svelte components. Note that the shortcut $ccs is not available in the components you write. You have to use 'carbon-components-svelte'. Tip You can also use the aliases/shortcuts for modules in your components. See Using builtin components for the list of aliases. For those relative paths, you have to pay attention to the path of your components. The extlibs are symbolically linked to the ~/.pipen/Pipeline/.report-workdir/src/extlibs/{{extlibs.split(\"/\")[-1]}} directory. So you have to use the relative path from the ~/.pipen/Pipeline/.report-workdir/src/extlibs/{{extlibs.split(\"/\")[-1]}} directory. So it is Okay to use the aliases/shortcuts when your components are directly under the extlibs directory. If your components are in a subdirectory, you have to go up more levels for the components. For example, let's say your component is in <extlibs>/components/MyComponent.svelte , then you have to import it like this: < script > // instead of using $libs import { Image } from '../../../components' ; </ script > Using other svelte components Can you use other svelte components? Yes. But you have to do it for every pipeline run. And you have to set report_nobuild to True . How? In the working directory ( ~/.pipen/Pipeline/.report-workdir/ ), remove node_modules and make a copy of package.json instead of a symbolinc link. This is important, you may not want to pollute the global one. For example, if you want to use smelte Then run npm install and npm install -D smelte In your template: < script > import { Chip } from \"smelte\" ; let closed = false ; let clicked = false ; </ script > < Chip icon = \"face\" removable selectable on : close = {() => closed = true } on : click = {() => clicked = true } > test </ Chip > Finally, run npm build to buld your reports Converting paths to urls When we write a report template, we usually specify the path on the file system to the resources. But when we want to deploy the report, we need to convert the paths to urls, so that the resources can be accessed by the browser. Here is the rule to convert the paths to urls: If the resource is a file from process results, which are usually stored in one-level up from the REPORTS directory, the path should be converted to a relative path to the REPORTS directory. For example, if the REPORTS directory is /path/to/REPORTS , the path to the resource is /path/to/someproc/image.png , then the converted path should be ../someproc/image.png . If the resource is a file from process results, but the process does not exports the results to the output directory (i.e. some intermediate processes), the resource will be copied to /path/to/REPORTS/data directory. The converted path should be data/image.<id>.png , where <id> is associated with the raw resource path. A relative path or a URL to the resource will be kept as is. When we are using other, self-defined or external components, we should register the tag and the property with the path for conversion. For example, if we have a component MyComponent that has a property src that is a path to a resource, we should register the tag and the property with the path for conversion, using the report_relpath_tags configuration. from pipen import Pipen class Pipeline ( Pipen ): plugin_opts = { \"report_relpath_tags\" : { \"MyComponent\" : \"src\" , \"MyComponent2\" : [ \"src\" , \"src2\" ], # multiple properties } } Already registered tags are: { \"a\" : \"href\" , \"embed\" : \"src\" , \"img\" : \"src\" , \"Link\" : \"href\" , \"Image\" : ( \"src\" , \"download\" ), \"ImageLoader\" : \"src\" , \"DataTable\" : \"src\" , \"iframe\" : \"src\" , \"Iframe\" : \"src\" , \"Plotly\" : \"src\" , \"Download\" : \"href\" , }","title":"Writing report templates"},{"location":"writing/#writing-reports","text":"","title":"Writing reports"},{"location":"writing/#using-carbon-components-svelte-components","text":"carbon-components-svelte is supported by default.

Then you can import the components from the path you specified. < script > import { MyComponent } from '$extlibs/MyComponent.svelte' ; </ script > You can write your own components based on carbon-components-svelte components. Note that the shortcut $ccs is not available in the components you write. You have to use 'carbon-components-svelte'. Tip You can also use the aliases/shortcuts for modules in your components. See Using builtin components for the list of aliases. For those relative paths, you have to pay attention to the path of your components. The extlibs are symbolically linked to the ~/.pipen/Pipeline/.report-workdir/src/extlibs/{{extlibs.split(\"/\")[-1]}} directory. So you have to use the relative path from the ~/.pipen/Pipeline/.report-workdir/src/extlibs/{{extlibs.split(\"/\")[-1]}} directory. So it is Okay to use the aliases/shortcuts when your components are directly under the extlibs directory. If your components are in a subdirectory, you have to go up more levels for the components.
